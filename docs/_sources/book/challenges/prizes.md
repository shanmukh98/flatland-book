Challenge Prizes
================

The prizes are four travel grants to come visit us at EPFL (Switzerland), a GeForce RTX 2080 Graphics Card and 3 NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit.

*   The **first place team** in the final round will be awarded one travel grant, whichever approach they use.
*   The **top three teams** in the final round which use a reinforcement learning approach for their winning submission will be awarded one travel grant each.
*   The **first place team** in the final round which uses a reinforcement learning approach for their winning submission will be awarded the **RTX 2080 GPU**.
*   The **second place team** which uses a reinforcement learning approach, as well as the **top two teams** which use another approach for their winning submission will be awarded a Jetson Nano Kit.

The approach used for each submission needs to be specified in the `aicrowd.json` file as described in the [submission guide](https://flatland.aicrowd.com/getting-started/first-submission.html).

The winning submissions will be verified manually by the organizers to ensure the method used matches what has been declared in the `aicrowd.json` file. The organizers have the final word when judging the validity of each submission.

```{note}
In the case where the overall first place team would use a reinforcement learning approach, then this team will be awarded two travel grants.
