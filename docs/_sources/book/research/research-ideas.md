### Strong Generalization and Efficiency in Neural Programs (Li et al.)

In this paper, DeepMind trains a neural program (a program "learned" using machine learning) to solve various tasks: sorting lists, solving knapsack problems... In some settings, the resulting algorithms perform better than the original hand-coded ones.

Could we use this for Flatland: instead of writing a planning solution ourselves, and instead of training an RL agent that learns to take decisions, what about we train a full program that learns to plan? 

> We study the problem of learning efficient algorithms that strongly generalize in the framework of neural program induction. By carefully designing the input / output interfaces of the neural model and through imitation, we are able to learn models that produce correct results for arbitrary input sizes, achieving strong generalization. Moreover, by using reinforcement learning, we optimize for program efficiency metrics, and discover new algorithms that surpass the teacher used in imitation. With this, our approach can learn to outperform custom-written solutions for a variety of problems, as we tested it on sorting, searching in ordered lists and the NP-complete 0/1 knapsack problem, which sets a notable milestone in the field of Neural Program Induction. As highlights, our learned model can perform sorting perfectly on any input data size we tested on, with O(nlogn) complexity, whilst outperforming hand-coded algorithms, including quick sort, in number of operations even for list sizes far beyond those seen during training.

### Comparison of path planning methods for a multi-robot team (Hvězda)

Comparison of path planning methods for a multi-robot team. Very similar to flatland environment, apart from the junction constraints, same speed, no failures...? (AFAICT). The algorithm assumes that the resource graph is constructed such that resources are of two types: intersection resources with capacity 1 and lane resources with capacity 1 or greater. Another assumption is also that if multiple agents are present on the same resource then they are all traveling in the same direction and their order does not change, meaning they cannot overtake each other. The idea is that the lanes are not wide enough for two agents to drive in parallel but long enough so that agents can drive behind each other.

> This master thesis discusses the topic of multi-agent pathplanning. For this reason several algorithms were picked and described in the first part of this thesis. All algorithms were implemented in C++ and from experience from working with these algorithms several modifications and improvements were proposed and implemented. The second part of the thesis elaborates on the results of experiments performed on the basic versions of the algorithms as well as the improvements and discusses their effect. This part discusses the potential applications the algorithms as well. All algorithms were tested on the map of robotic warehouse as well as grid maps from pc games.

### Chip Placement with Deep Reinforcement Learning (Mirhoseini et al.)

This work from Google AI uses reinforcement learning to place chips on a PCB. This placement problem could be seen as a planning problem, if you consider the electric lines as trains which need to reach a destination without blocking each other. 

> In this work, we present a learning-based approach to chip placement, one of the most complex and time-consuming stages of the chip design process. Unlike prior methods, our approach has the ability to learn from past experience and improve over time. In particular, as we train over a greater number of chip blocks, our method becomes better at rapidly generating optimized placements for previously unseen chip blocks. To achieve these results, we pose placement as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem and train an agent to place the nodes of a chip netlist onto a chip canvas. To enable our RL policy to generalize to unseen blocks, we ground representation learning in the supervised task of predicting placement quality. By designing a neural architecture that can accurately predict reward across a wide variety of netlists and their placements, we are able to generate rich feature embeddings of the input netlists. We then use this architecture as the encoder of our policy and value networks to enable transfer learning. (...)

### Shunting Trains with Deep Reinforcement Learning  (Peer, E., Menkovski, V., Zhang, Y., & Lee, W-J. (2018))

> The Train Unit Shunting Problem (TUSP) is a
difficult sequential decision making problem faced by Dutch
Railways (NS). Current heuristic solutions under study at NS fall
short in accounting for uncertainty during plan execution and
do not efficiently support replanning. Furthermore, the resulting
plans lack consistency. We approach the TUSP by formulating
it as a Markov Decision Process and develop an image-like
state space representation that allows us to develop a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution. The Deep Q-Network
efficiently reduces the state space and develops an on-line strategy
for the TUSP capable of dealing with uncertainty and delivering
significantly more consistent solutions compared to approaches
currently being developed by NS.

### Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Reinforcement Learning

https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09940 (from Jeremy)

> This paper presents a framework to tackle combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks and reinforcement learning. We focus on the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and train a recurrent network that, given a set of city coordinates, predicts a distribution over different city permutations. Using negative tour length as the reward signal, we optimize the parameters of the recurrent network using a policy gradient method. We compare learning the network parameters on a set of training graphs against learning them on individual test graphs. Despite the computational expense, without much engineering and heuristic designing, Neural Combinatorial Optimization achieves close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs with up to 100 nodes. Applied to the KnapSack, another NP-hard problem, the same method obtains optimal solutions for instances with up to 200 items.

Couple of implementations (2-3 years old):
- https://github.com/MichelDeudon/neural-combinatorial-optimization-rl-tensorflow  (I just ran training; but I think it needs an old version of Google OR Tools for testing, or a bit of updating itself)
- https://github.com/pemami4911/neural-combinatorial-rl-pytorch  Not tried this yet. (Florian: this guy generally does good work)

### Attention, Learn to Solve Routing Problems!

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08475v3.pdf (from Nilabha)

> The recently presented idea to learn heuristics for combinatorial optimization
  problems is promising as it can save costly development. However, to push this
  idea towards practical implementation, we need better models and better ways
  of training. We contribute in both directions: we propose a model based on attention layers with benefits over the Pointer Network and we show how to train
  this model using REINFORCE with a simple baseline based on a deterministic
  greedy rollout, which we find is more efficient than using a value function. We
  significantly improve over recent learned heuristics for the Travelling Salesman
  Problem (TSP), getting close to optimal results for problems up to 100 nodes.
  With the same hyperparameters, we learn strong heuristics for two variants of the
  Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the Orienteering Problem (OP) and (a stochastic variant of) the Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP), outperforming a wide range of
  baselines and getting results close to highly optimized and specialized algorithms.


### Conflict-free route planning in dynamic environments

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221063712_Conflict-free_route_planning_in_dynamic_environments (form Jeremy)

> Motion  planning  for  multiple  robots  is  tractable in  case  we  can  assume  a  roadmap  on  which  all  the  robotstravel, which is often the case in many automated guided vehicledomains,  such  as  factory  floors  or  container  terminals.  Wepresent  anO(nvlog(nv) +n2v)(nthe  number  of  nodes,vthe  number  of  vehicles)  route  planning  algorithm  for  a  singlerobot,  which  can  find  the  minimum-time  route  given  a  set  ofexisting  route  plans  that  it  may  not  interfere  with.In  addition,  we  present  an  algorithm  that  can  propagatedelay  through  the  plans  of  the  robots  in  case  one  or  morerobots are delayed. This delay-propagation algorithm allows usto implement a Pareto-optimal plan repair scheme, in which onerobot can improve its route plan without adversely affecting theother robots. We compare this approach to several plan repairschemes  from  the  literature,  which  are  based  on  the  idea  ofgiving  a  higher  priority  to  non-delayed  agents
