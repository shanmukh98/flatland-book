Single agent
===

```{admonition} Goal
In this tutorial, you will train a single agent to navigate in Flatland environments using DQN.
```

We use the [`single_agent_training.py`](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/neurips2020-flatland-starter-kit/blob/master/reinforcement_learning/single_agent_training.py) file to train a simple agent using tree observations. This tutorial walks you through this file step by step.

Setting up the environment
---

Before you get started with the training, you will need to have [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installed. You can install everything you need with conda using the `environment.yml` file:

```console
$ conda env create environment.yml
```

We start by importing the necessary flatland modules:

```python
from flatland.envs.rail_env import RailEnv
from flatland.envs.rail_generators import sparse_rail_generator
from flatland.envs.schedule_generators import sparse_schedule_generator
from utils.observation_utils import normalize_observation
from flatland.envs.observations import TreeObsForRailEnv
```

For this simple example we want to train on randomly generated levels using the `sparse_schedule_generator`. We use the following parameter for our first experiment:

```python
# Parameters for the Environment
n_agents = 1
x_dim = 25
y_dim = 25
n_cities = 4
max_rails_between_cities = 2
max_rails_in_city = 3
seed = 42
```

It is possible to train "speed profiles", which simulate different kinds of trains with different speeds. In the NeurIPS 2020 challenge, we only consider trains with a speed of `1.0`, so we setup the speed profiles accordingly: 

```python
# Different agent types (trains) with different speeds.
speed_ration_map = {
    1.: 1.0,  # 100% of fast passenger train
    1. / 2.: 0.0,  # 0% of fast freight train
    1. / 3.: 0.0,  # 0% of slow commuter train
    1. / 4.: 0.0  # 0% of slow freight train
}
```

For this experiment we will use the tree observation:

```python
# We are training an Agent using the Tree Observation with depth 2
observation_tree_depth = 2

observation_builder = TreeObsForRailEnv(max_depth=observation_tree_depth)
```

We then pass it as an argument to the environment constructor:

```python
env = RailEnv(
    width=x_dim,
    height=y_dim,
    rail_generator=sparse_rail_generator(
        max_num_cities=n_cities,
        seed=seed,
        grid_mode=False,
        max_rails_between_cities=max_rails_between_cities,
        max_rails_in_city=max_rails_in_city
    ),
    schedule_generator=sparse_schedule_generator(),
    number_of_agents=n_agents,
    obs_builder_object=tree_observation
)
```

We have now successfully set up the environment for training!

Setting up the policy
---

To set up an appropriate agent we need the state and action space sizes. We calculate this based on the tree depth and its number of features:

```python
# Calculate the state size given the depth of the tree observation and the number of features
n_features_per_node = env.obs_builder.observation_dim
n_nodes = 0
for i in range(observation_tree_depth + 1):
    n_nodes += np.power(4, i)
state_size = n_features_per_node * n_nodes

# The action space of flatland is 5 discrete actions
action_size = 5
```

We train the agent with a Double Duelling DQN policy. Here are the relevant publications for this method:
- [DQN method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)
- [Double DQN method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)
- [Duelling DQN method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581)

```python
# Double Dueling DQN policy
policy = DDDQNPolicy(state_size, action_size, Namespace(**training_parameters))
```

In the `single_agent_training.py` file you will find further bookkeeping variable that we initiate in order to keep track of the training progress. We omit them here for brevity. 

We reshape and normalize each tree observation provided by the environment to facilitate training. To do so, we use the utility functions `normalize_observation(observation: TreeObsForRailEnv.Node, tree_depth: int, observation_radius=0)` defined [in the utils folder](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland-examples/blob/master/utils/observation_utils.py).

```python
# Build agent specific observations
for a in range(env.get_num_agents()):
    if obs[a]:
        agent_obs[a] = normalize_observation(obs[a], tree_depth, observation_radius=10)
```

We now use the normalized `agent_obs` in our training loop:

```python
for episode_idx in range(1, n_episodes + 1):
    # Reset environment
    obs, info = env.reset(True, True)
    # Build agent specific observations
    for a in range(env.get_num_agents()):
        if obs[a]:
            agent_obs[a] = normalize_observation(obs[a], tree_depth, observation_radius=10)
            agent_prev_obs[a] = agent_obs[a].copy()

    # Reset score and done
    score = 0
    env_done = 0

    # Run episode
    for step in range(max_steps):
        # Action
        for a in range(env.get_num_agents()):
            if info['action_required'][a]:
                # If an action is require, we want to store the obs at that step as well as the action
                update_values = True
                action = agent.act(agent_obs[a], eps=eps)
                action_prob[action] += 1
            else:
                update_values = False
                action = 0
            action_dict.update({a: action})

        # Environment step
        next_obs, all_rewards, done, info = env.step(action_dict)
        # Update replay buffer and train agent
        for a in range(env.get_num_agents()):
            # Only update the values when we are done or when an action was taken and thus relevant information is present
            if update_values or done[a]:
                agent.step(agent_prev_obs[a], agent_prev_action[a], all_rewards[a], agent_obs[a], done[a])
                cumulated_reward[a] = 0.

                agent_prev_obs[a] = agent_obs[a].copy()
                agent_prev_action[a] = action_dict[a]

            if next_obs[a]:
                agent_obs[a] = normalize_observation(next_obs[a], tree_depth, observation_radius=10)

            score += all_rewards[a] / env.get_num_agents()

        # Copy observation
        if done['__all__']:
            env_done = 1
            break

    # Epsilon decay
    eps = max(eps_end, eps_decay * eps)  # decrease epsilon
```

Results

Running the `single_agent_training.py` file trains a simple agent to navigate to any random target within the railway network. After running you should see a learning curve similar to this one:

![Learning_curve](https://i.imgur.com/yVGXpUy.png)

and the agent behavior should look like this:

![Single_Agent_Navigation](https://i.imgur.com/t5ULr4L.gif)

This is a good start! In the next page, we will see how to train a policy that can handle multiple agents in a more robust way. You will then be able to **submit it to the AMLD 2021 Flatland challenge!**
