Reinforcement Learning
===

```{note}
Looking for industrial-strength RL baselines? Head over to the [RLlib baselines](../research/baselines) to find full implementations of methods such as Ape-X, PPO and imitation learning algorithms.
```

Let's get our hands dirty with some simple reinforcement learning methods! We will solve tasks such as the one pictured below using DQN implementations written from scratch using PyTorch.

- The [single agent](rl/single-agent) tutorial will guide through a basic Dueling Double DQN implementation which controls a single train
- The [multi agent](rl/multi-agent) tutorial shows how to extend this method to the multi-agent setting. You will then be able to submit this agent to the NeurIPS 2020 Flatland challenge!

The code for these examples can be found in [the starter kit repository](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland-starter-kit).
