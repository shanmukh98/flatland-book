Writing documentation
=====================

Flatland is a complex research project that evolved quickly. As such, its documentation isn't quite up to date, and some parts are plagued with typos and inconsistencies. Your help on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

To improve the documentation, follow this simple process:

1. Fork the `flatland-book` repository, which contains the documentation you're currently reading

    ```console
    $ git clone git@gitlab.aicrowd.com:flatland/flatland-book.git
    ```
    
2. Write or fix the documentation as intented

3. Add your name under "Contributors" in the [Credits page](credits)

4. Open a pull request to allow mainteners to review and merge your changes.

That's it! you will soon join the list of official Flatland contributors ðŸŒŸ
